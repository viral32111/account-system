This is a demonstration of a perfect user account (login & registration) system that I believe all websites should adopt.

## üìÖ History

This was originally started in 2020 using PHP 7 and a MySQL 5 database. This version is available on the [php branch](https://github.com/viral32111/account-system/tree/php) or [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/viral32111/account-system/releases/tag/1.0.0).

In July of 2023, I uploaded the original project to GitHub and rewrote it to be a full-stack [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) MVC (C#/Razor) service using [Microsoft SQL Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022). I chose this framework as I wanted to learn SQL Server so I might as well use Microsoft's other products, plus I had already made numerous full-stack web applications in the past using Node.js/MongoDB so it seemed silly to use those again.
